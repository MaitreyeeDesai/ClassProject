EMAIL CAMPAIGN

Email Campaign is a website which is a new approach to email marketing and delivery. The aim of the new application is to help email senders increase their email open rate by increasing the number of messages actually viewed and decreasing the number of messages blocked by aggressive spam filters. As the name of the website suggests - We help customers in sending the emails easily and getting them opened! We do this by thinking about email in new and different ways. Emails are customized to maximize their effectiveness which ensures the message is sent, opened and read.

We do subject analysis in which the subject line is analysed and suggestions are made so that the email subject line is catchy.
Email Campaign is inspired from the emailopened.com website. This application was developed as a class project.

We used MySQL, Node.js, html5, bootsrap to develop this application.
